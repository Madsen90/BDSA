We aim to build a system that is a simple and smart replacement of the old-fashioned paper calender. In order to achieve this, we wish the system to be easy to understand, easy to use and easily accessible. Because how can we replace something if our alternative is not better than what we want to replace? \\
Furthermore we aim to build a system that brings people closer. We want to enable our users to meet new strange and exciting people and try new things. And we want them to be able to do this all the time. All day, every day. So we must ensure that our system support a lot of data without performance loss, never losses track of saved appointments, and, of course, back up our users' data securely.
