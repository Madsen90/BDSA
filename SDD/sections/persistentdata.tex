We have identified the following persistent objects; APPOINTMENTS, LUCKYAPPOINTMENTS, USERS and NOFICATIONS. They are all saved by the server subsystem in a relational Database. When the Client starts up it synchronizes the APPOINTMENTS, LUCKYAPPOINTMENTS and NOTIFICATIONS with the server, so that the Client subsystem is up to date with the changes that have been made by other users and the LuckyMatchFinder. If local changes have not been saved to the server (probably due to loss of network connection) since the program was last used by the logged on User.

We considered saving persistent boundary objects locally, such as user preferences and last shown view, but we decided against it, since the client is supposed to be simple and intuitive, with ease of use and accessibility as declared design goals, making these boundary objects persistent, should not be necessary.
