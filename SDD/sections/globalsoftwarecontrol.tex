The Client will generally be using an event-driven control flow. There will be a main-loop listening to for GUI-events and when an event happens it is handled by the relevant controller-class. We still might want to have several threads running, e.g. the ConnectionHandler. Similarly the LuckyMatchFinder running on the server will probably be pretty procedural as it is run x times a day and never even waits events.
