Since our system uses the Client-Server pattern, we need an independent server, that stores all data centrally and runs our LuckyMatchFinder algorithm. The server communicates through a http-connection with a user logged on locally through the client subsystem. The connection is handled by the DataHandler subsystem on the server and the Model subsystem on the Client. The DataHandler part on the server encapsulates a SQL-database. The Client is also able to save data locally, if unable to connect to the server. The Model uses a Bridge pattern to apply the different data handling interfaces, these are assigned through an Abstract factory.
