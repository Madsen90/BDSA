\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose of the system}
	The unique purpose of our system is to be replace the old fashioned paper calendar. That is, the system must   Our system may at first glance look as a pretty generic calender-system, due to it's very simplistic setup. It is, however, not that generic, since there, to our knowledge, doesn't exist a calendar-system that does not restrict its user im some way or other in the interest of giving more functionality. We have instead focused on making it easy to create appointments with other people, and giving the user an almost autonomous power with his or her calendar.

			Note: We need to figure out how to handle user-relationsship. 
			It is unlikely everybody able to invite all users. Do we have user-friendship, groups.. etc?
