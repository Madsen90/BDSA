There exist a lot of different calendar system and it is not possible for us to analyze all of them.
To our knowledge there doesn't exist a calendar which core idea is to let people meet new people. 
Facebook has an event system with the possibility of having an open event. However we don't think that open events encourage total strangers to join an event, unless the event is some sort of mass gathering. 
In addition if a person where to actively seek something to do Friday night it is not possible to seek open events for a period of time. 
An extensive analysis of other calendar system should be done, but we think it is out of the scope of this assignment.
