\subsection{Overview}


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
LuckyCalendar is a calendar system with special functionality allowing users to find new experiences. LuckyCalendar has standard calendar functionality that allows a user to create an appointment, add other users to the appointment and synchronize with GoogleCalendar. LuckyCalendar has a flat-structured user-system, which means that there is no owners of an appointment which allows all normal participants to edit an appointment. \\

In addition LuckyCalendar introduces the functionality of a LuckyAppointment, which allows the user to mark a period of time in her calendar, where she wishes to have an appointment. If another user has made an Appointment with room for LuckyParticipants within the time frame and area, the original user is added to this appointment. A LuckyParticipant does not have rights to edit an appointment, this is the only kind of ownership in the Calendar.\\

Lastly since LuckyCalendar is specialized in its ability to let people make new acquaintances, users might want to use it is a supplement to other calendar systems, therefor LuckyCalendar should be able to synchronize with Google Calendar.
