\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose of the system}
		The purpose of our calendar system is to replace the old fashioned paper calendar with a twist. The calendars client will work on most systems and very basic hardware, and as such it may seem quite simplistic. It will implement basic calendar funcionality such as keeping track of your appointments, and invite other users to your appointments etc. 

		However, the calendar stands out in its abillity to set up appointments between strangers. This functionality, leaves room for extra unknown participants to be added to an event or appointment by our server. These unknown participants will, in their own calendar, make en "empty" appointment, where they want to be invited to a random event near them. That way people lacking, for instance participants for a street party, a bingo tournament or even a 4th player in a tenis double match, will be able to find their extra people. And people lacking something to do while on a buisness trip to a foreign city, or simply someone who is bored on a saturday, will get and invite to something new, with new at exiting people.

		We call it - LuckyAppointments.
